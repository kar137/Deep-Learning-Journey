# Deep-Learning-Journey

Welcome to my Deep Learning Journey! This repository documents my progress as I learn and implement concepts from deep learning, with a current focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## ðŸ“š Current Focus: NLP

I am currently learning NLP by following the [DeepLearning.AI NLP Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing). The `NLP/` folder contains my notes, assignments, and code as I work through the specialization and related topics.
