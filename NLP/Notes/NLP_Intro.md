# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Introduction

## Introduction to NLP

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of computer science, linguistics, and AI that enables communication between humans and machines using natural language.

Common NLP applications: **Google Search**, **Alexa**, **Siri**, **Google Assistant**, **Chatbots**.

## Human Language vs Machine Understanding

- **Human Language**: Tool for expressing ideas via written/spoken words, gestures, signs.
- Unique trait: **Compositionality** – the ability to create infinite sentences with limited vocabulary.
- Animals use symbols/sounds, but human language is far more complex.

---

## What is NLP?

- NLP enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
- Focuses on **information extraction** from human input and producing understandable output.
- NLP draws from:
  - Linguistics
  - Artificial Intelligence
  - Computer Science

## Brief History of NLP

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1950 | Alan Turing proposes the **Turing Test** |
| 1954 | **Machine Translation** experiments begin (Russian ↔ English) |
| 1960 | Contributions by **Noam Chomsky** to linguistics |
| 1980s | Shift from rule-based to **probabilistic models** |
| 2000+ | **Deep Learning dominates** NLP research due to data explosion |

---

## Why NLP?

- Human language ≠ Machine language.
- NLP **bridges the gap** between human communication and computer understanding.
- Enables processing of vast textual data available on the web.

---

## Why is NLP Difficult?

- Human language is:
  - **Ambiguous**
  - **Contextual**
  - Constantly **evolving**
- Challenges:
  - **Multiple interpretations** (semantic, syntactic, pragmatic)
  - **Background knowledge** required (e.g., “it” in a sentence)
  - Influence of **demographics, dialects, slang, sarcasm**, etc.

## Types of Ambiguity in Language

| Type                | Description | Example |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Phonological**    | Words sound the same | *Eye* vs *I*, *No* vs *Know* |
| **Lexical**         | One word, multiple meanings | *Bank*: River bank or financial institution |
| **Syntactic**       | Ambiguity from sentence structure | *The tourist saw the child with a telescope* |
| **Semantic**        | Uncertainty in sentence meaning | *Mark and Elizabeth got married last week* |
| **Pragmatic**       | Depends on context & speaker's intention | *I love chicken* (food vs animal) |

### How to Handle Ambiguity

To address ambiguity:
- Use **world knowledge** and **context**.
- Perform multiple levels of language analysis:
  - Morphological
  - Syntactic
  - Semantic
  - Pragmatic

## Multidisciplinary Nature of NLP

NLP is not only technical but also social, cognitive, and linguistic in nature:

| Field               | Role in NLP |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Linguistics**     | Structure of words and sentences |
| **Psycholinguistics** | How humans comprehend language |
| **Cognitive Modeling** | Computational models of language |
| **Philosophy**      | Semantics and world knowledge |
| **Computer Science** | Implementation of NLP algorithms |
| **Artificial Intelligence** | Reasoning, inference, knowledge representation |
| **Statistics**      | Probabilistic models (e.g., N-grams) |
| **Machine Learning** | Learn patterns, automate decision-making |
